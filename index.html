                <p>I was brought up in humble family by a single parent, my mum, who underwent rejection and pain but still fought
                    tirelessly and ensured that we survived. My dad passed on in <strong>2004</strong> when I was 4 and my brother was 7.
                </p>
                <p>After My Dad's burial, things were not like the same. A few years after his burial we had to relocate back to the 
                    village Busia, Kenya. Life wasn't the same again, it was like we were living in a different world, everything we were
                    used to was no longer in our new home. No electricity, no running water, no vision of hope or posibility.
